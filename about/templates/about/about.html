                        Hello, my name is Shakira Lacroes, the face behind Fancy Day Design. As a young girl I regularly did photo shoots with my sisters. Everything had to be perfect, not only our clothes but also the background had to be in the right style. Even then I knew my awareness of decorating was growing and when it would stand out in a photo.

                        Before I started decorating, I was active in youth care for many years. I've always enjoyed doing this. In all those years I have organized and decorated various birthdays, baby showers for almost everyone in my immediate environment. Because of my passion for decorating, it was a logical step to do this professionally as a professional party stylist. At the moment I'm providing parties that are unforgettable.

                        I have already successfully contributed to many events. I am proud of the good reviews and if the customer is happy, my goal has been achieved! Also, there are already thousands of people who like and follow me on Instagram

                        As a customer you expect the highest level of quality from Fancy Day Design, together with the most pampering beautiful and unforgettable party experience. With wisdom and experience comes an eye for detail. It is this expectation of luxury that forms the basis of my work as a party stylist.
