**Icons**

-   [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for my forms and buttons, 
    to make it more appealing.

-   The Fancy Day design logo is used for the favicon. There has been made use of [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) to create this favicon.

**Colour Scheme**

The colors used for this website have been selected by Shakira Lacroes (owner).

THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATION USE ONLY

For the main foundation of this website I used Project - Boutique Ado. Then I modified it to this website.

Most of the photos used for the website were made by Shakira Lacroes (owner). To fill up the product page I used some other pictures from pexels.com and adobe stock.
Obtained from Pexels.com: 

-	Ring Balloon & Happy Birthday Balloon - Polina Tankilevitch

-	Love Balloon - Cottonbro

Obtained from stock.adobe.com/nl/free: 

-	All-numbers balloon. From this image I took all the individual photos of the numbers and used them for the products.

-	All-Alphabet letters balloon. From this image I took all the individual photos of the letters and used them for the products.

-	Gender reveal balloon.


The content of the about.html page is written by Shakira Lacroes the owner (and my sister in law) of Fancy Day Design.

I want to thank my friends and family who have viewed my website multiple times, have given me good criticism on my website and for putting up with my moodiness these past few weeks.

I would also want to thank my mentor who believed in me that I can do this project in 3 weeks and my fellow student Daphne for always staying positive!
