# **Milestone Project 4**
**THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

**FANCY DAY DESIGN**

For my final project I chose to create a website for my sister-in-law. About 2 years ago she started making balloon decorations. From tiny balloon arches to elaborate themes for birthdays, weddings and other celebrations.<br />

The website focuses on the work of Fancy Day Design but also the simple products that are sold there. The website also features a blog where ideas and comments can be submitted.

This website is for educational purposes only, so
do not attempt to enter real credit card information when using the stripe functionality. For testing purposes you can use the data below:

-   Stripe card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
-   Any card end date (in the future) you wish
-   Anyy CVV number you wish
