## Milestone Project 4
**THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

**FANCY DAY DESIGN**
---

For my final project I chose to create a website for my sister-in-law. About 2 years ago she started making balloon decorations. From tiny balloon arches to elaborate themes for birthdays, weddings and other celebrations.<br />

The website focuses on the work of Fancy Day Design but also the simple products that are sold there. The website also features a blog where ideas and comments can be submitted.

This website is for educational purposes only, so

# UX <a name="ux"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

As a final assignment I always said that I would make a website for my sister-in-law. Her decoration business has quickly grown into something big in a short time.
She has indicated what she finds important, what her website should have. I set to work with her wishes and incorporated them into the website. She chose the colors for the website herself. and I was free to choose the different images.

For this website I have created a blog page so that the selected admins can write articles on the site.

Only admin users can make updates and/or delete products or articles on the site. While 'normal' site users review, edit/delete various products and comment on the blog page.

## Surface <a name="surface"></a>
For the main foundation of this website I used the videos of Boutique ado. Then this is adapted to the chosen design. I wanted to make the site as simple as possible and process all the points my sister-in-law passed on. A different starting image was first chosen. But I didn't like it that much, so I changed it. The photo that has been chosen fits more with the look of the site.

In the navigation and throughout the website, when clicking on the logo it will lead you back to the homepage. The website generally has a fresh look and is user-friendly.

## **Fixed Issues**

## **Deployment**

#### Deployment to Heroku

1.  Create an app on the Heroku website called fancydaydesign

    * Click on "New" button.
    * Click on the "Create new app".
    * Create "App name" > fancydaydesign and chose "Choose a region" > europe as my closest region.
    * "Create app".

2. Set up Postgres database.

    Heroku:
    * Click "Resources" and search for postgres.
    * Chose "add to project" and chose the free plan for my project.
    * In order to use Postgres, Install two dependecies in gitpod;
        dj_database_url and psycopg2
    
    Gitpod:
    * To install dj_database_url and psycopg2 use the command:
          * `pip install`
    * Use the command: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt, to add the dependencies to the requirements file which is needed by Heroku.
        * In settings.py import dj_database_url:
            * `import dj_database_url`
        * Commented out the current database settings and replaced it with the settings of the postgres database:
        ```
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
        }
        ```
        * DATABASE_URL above is an environmental variable and as such should not be shown in version control. The database url can be found from your app config settings in heroku.
        * Once the above method is set up, the models need to be migrated to the new database using the command below:
            * `python3 manage.py migrate`
        * Create a new superuser for my site on heroku using the command below:
            * `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
        * Commit the changes and make sure not to include environmnet variables in the version control.
        * Created an if-else statement in the settings.py to use Postgres if the DATABASE_URL variable is available and otherwise use the default database in gitpod.
        ```
        if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
                DATABASES = {
                    "default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
                }
          else:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': {
                        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                    }
                }
        ```
        * The postgres database is now be ready for use.

    Gunicorn:
        * For the app to work on heroku. Instal Gunicorn
            * `pip3 install Gunicorn`
        * Create a Procfile to tell heroku how to run our app.
            * `touch Procfile`
        * In Procfile add:
            * `web: gunicorn <appname>.wsgi:application`
    
    * Connect to Heroku in the terminal on gitpod
        * `heroku login -i`
        * Login with your email and password that you used to create an account with on heroku website.
        * Disable the collection of static files temporarily until AWS has been set up.
            * `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <appname>`
            * Use the --app command when you have more than one app in your heroku account
        * In settings add heroku into my list of allowed hosts, and localhost so the project can still b run locally using the following settings.
            * `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["<heroku appname>.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]`
        * Push to Github 
        * Push to Heroku. first
            * `heroku git:remote -a <heroku appname>`
        * Then push the project to Heroku using:
            * `git push heroku master`
    
    Go back to Heroku Website;
        * Go to the deploy section of the app.
        * Search for the app being used in github.
        * When found connected and click on "Enable Automatic deploys"

                    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "<bucket name>"
                    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "<bucket region>"
                    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID") # taken from downloaded csv file

THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATION USE ONLY

For the main foundation of this website I used videos from Code Institute - Project - Boutique Ado. Then I modified it to this website.

Most of the photos used for the website were made by Shakira Lacroes (owner). To fill up the product page I used some other pictures from pexels.com and adobe stock.
Obtained from Pexels.com: 

-	Ring Balloon & Happy Birthday Balloon - Polina Tankilevitch

-	Love Balloon - Cottonbro

Obtained from stock.adobe.com/nl/free: 

-	All-numbers balloon. From this image I took all the individual photos of the numbers and used them for the products.

-	All-Alphabet letters balloon. From this image I took all the individual photos of the letters and used them for the products.

-	Gender reveal balloon.


The content of the about.html page is written by Shakira Lacroes the owner (and my sister in law) of Fancy Day Design.

I want to thank my friends and family who have viewed my website multiple times, have given me good criticism on my website and for putting up with my moodiness these past few weeks.

I would also want to thank my mentor who believed in me that I can do this project in 3 weeks and my fellow student Daphne for always staying positive!
