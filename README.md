# **Milestone Project 4**
**THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

**FANCY DAY DESIGN**

For my final project I chose to create a website for my sister-in-law. About 2 years ago she started making balloon decorations. From tiny balloon arches to elaborate themes for birthdays, weddings and other celebrations.<br />

The website focuses on the work of Fancy Day Design but also the simple products that are sold there. The website also features a blog where ideas and comments can be submitted.

THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATION USE ONLY

For the main foundation of this website I used Project - Boutique Ado. Then I modified it to this website.

Most of the photos used for the website were made by Shakira Lacroes (owner). To fill up the product page I used some other pictures from pexels.com and adobe stock.
Obtained from Pexels.com: 

-	Ring Balloon & Happy Birthday Balloon - Polina Tankilevitch

-	Love Balloon - Cottonbro

Obtained from stock.adobe.com/nl/free: 

-	All-numbers balloon. From this image I took all the individual photos of the numbers and used them for the products.

-	All-Alphabet letters balloon. From this image I took all the individual photos of the letters and used them for the products.

-	Gender reveal balloon.


The content of the about.html page is written by Shakira Lacroes the owner (and my sister in law) of Fancy Day Design.
