## Milestone Project 4
**THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

**FANCY DAY DESIGN**
---

For my final project I chose to create a website for my sister-in-law. About 2 years ago she started making balloon decorations. From tiny balloon arches to elaborate themes for birthdays, weddings and other celebrations.<br />

The website focuses on the work of Fancy Day Design but also the simple products that are sold there. The website also features a blog where ideas and comments can be submitted.

This website is for educational purposes only, so
do not attempt to enter real credit card information when using the stripe functionality. For testing purposes you can use the data below:

# UX <a name="ux"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

As a final assignment I always said that I would make a website for my sister-in-law. Her decoration business has quickly grown into something big in a short time.
She has indicated what she finds important, what her website should have. I set to work with her wishes and incorporated them into the website. She chose the colors for the website herself. and I was free to choose the different images.

For this website I have created a blog page so that the selected admins can write articles on the site.

Only admin users can make updates and/or delete products or articles on the site. While 'normal' site users review, edit/delete various products and comment on the blog page.
