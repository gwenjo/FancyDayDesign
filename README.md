## Milestone Project 4
**THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

**FANCY DAY DESIGN**
---

For my final project I chose to create a website for my sister-in-law. About 2 years ago she started making balloon decorations. From tiny balloon arches to elaborate themes for birthdays, weddings and other celebrations.<br />

The website focuses on the work of Fancy Day Design but also the simple products that are sold there. The website also features a blog where ideas and comments can be submitted.

This website is for educational purposes only, so
do not attempt to enter real credit card information when using the stripe functionality. For testing purposes you can use the data below:

-   Stripe card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
-   Any card end date (in the future) you wish
-   Anyy CVV number you wish

# UX <a name="ux"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

As a final assignment I always said that I would make a website for my sister-in-law. Her decoration business has quickly grown into something big in a short time.
She has indicated what she finds important, what her website should have. I set to work with her wishes and incorporated them into the website. She chose the colors for the website herself. and I was free to choose the different images.

For this website I have created a blog page so that the selected admins can write articles on the site.

Only admin users can make updates and/or delete products or articles on the site. While 'normal' site users review, edit/delete various products and comment on the blog page.

## Surface <a name="surface"></a>

## **Fixed Issues**

I am aware that there are several bugs in my code. I ran out of time. As a single parent of three, I don't have much choice. I also work full time. My deadline is now. Because I didn't have time I couldn't have contact with my mentor

I have not been able to perform all the tests.


## **Deployment**
---
#### Deployment to Heroku

1.  Create an app on the Heroku website called fancydaydesign

    * Click on "New" button.
    * Click on the "Create new app".
    * Create "App name" > fancydaydesign and chose "Choose a region" > europe as my closest region.
    * "Create app".

2. Set up Postgres database.

    Heroku:
    * Click "Resources" and search for postgres.
    * Chose "add to project" and chose the free plan for my project.
    * In order to use Postgres, Install two dependecies in gitpod;
        dj_database_url and psycopg2
    
    Gitpod:
    * To install dj_database_url and psycopg2 use the command:
          * `pip install`
    * Use the command: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt, to add the dependencies to the requirements file which is needed by Heroku.
        * In settings.py import dj_database_url:
            * `import dj_database_url`
        * Commented out the current database settings and replaced it with the settings of the postgres database:
        ```
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
        }
        ```
        * DATABASE_URL above is an environmental variable and as such should not be shown in version control. The database url can be found from your app config settings in heroku.
        * Once the above method is set up, the models need to be migrated to the new database using the command below:
            * `python3 manage.py migrate`
        * Create a new superuser for my site on heroku using the command below:
            * `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
        * Commit the changes and make sure not to include environmnet variables in the version control.
        * Created an if-else statement in the settings.py to use Postgres if the DATABASE_URL variable is available and otherwise use the default database in gitpod.
        ```
        if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
                DATABASES = {
                    "default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
                }
          else:
                DATABASES = {
                    'default': {
                        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
                    }
                }
        ```
        * The postgres database is now be ready for use.

    Gunicorn:
        * For the app to work on heroku. Instal Gunicorn
            * `pip3 install Gunicorn`
        * Create a Procfile to tell heroku how to run our app.
            * `touch Procfile`
        * In Procfile add:
            * `web: gunicorn <appname>.wsgi:application`
    
    * Connect to Heroku in the terminal on gitpod
        * `heroku login -i`
        * Login with your email and password that you used to create an account with on heroku website.
        * Disable the collection of static files temporarily until AWS has been set up.
            * `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <appname>`
            * Use the --app command when you have more than one app in your heroku account
        * In settings add heroku into my list of allowed hosts, and localhost so the project can still b run locally using the following settings.
            * `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["<heroku appname>.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]`
        * Push to Github 
        * Push to Heroku. first
            * `heroku git:remote -a <heroku appname>`
        * Then push the project to Heroku using:
            * `git push heroku master`
    
    Go back to Heroku Website;
        * Go to the deploy section of the app.
        * Search for the app being used in github.
        * When found connected and click on "Enable Automatic deploys"
        * Any changes made and pushed to Github will automatically be pushed to Heroku.
    
    Amazon AWS;
    * Create an AWS account.

### Content and Media

THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATION USE ONLY

For the main foundation of this website I used videos from Code Institute - Project - Boutique Ado. Then I modified it to this website.


The content of the about.html page is written by Shakira Lacroes the owner (and my sister in law) of Fancy Day Design.

**Code I have used**
Used websites and images:

Review Forms and Add to Database using forms | Build Movie Review Website Using Django 2020.
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSX8nzu9ozg)

[Building A Blog Application With Django](https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/)

Wat is een blog? [Dutch Page](https://www.blogkracht.nl/wat-is-een-blog/) 

Create A Simple Django Blog from [Codemy.com](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=make+a+blog+with+django)

* [bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to style the site and to make it more visually appealing for the reader and user.

* Some of the backend code was taken from the walkthrough project of Boutique Ado and some frontend bootstrap classes are similar to what was used in the walthrough project as I wanted a similar feel for my site.


### Media

Most of the images used for the website were made by Shakira Lacroes (owner). To fill up the product page I used some other pictures from pexels.com and adobe stock.
Obtained from Pexels.com: 

-	Ring Balloon & Happy Birthday Balloon - Polina Tankilevitch
